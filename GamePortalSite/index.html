	<h2>Definition</h2>
	<article>
	<p>Strategy video games are a genre of video game that emphasize skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory.
		Specifically, a player must plan a series of actions against one or more opponents, and the reduction of enemy
		forces is usually a goal. Victory is achieved through superior planning, and the element of chance takes a
		smaller role. In most strategy video games, the player is given a godlike view of the game world, and indirectly
		controls game units under their command. Thus, most strategy games involve elements of warfare to varying
		degrees, and feature a combination of tactical and strategic considerations. In addition to combat, these games
		often challenge the player's ability to explore, or manage an economy.</p>

	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>
		The origin of strategy video games is rooted in traditional tabletop strategy games like Chess and Go, as well
		as board and miniature wargaming. The first console strategy game was a Risk-like game called Invasion, released
		in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey. Strategic Simulations (SSI)'s Computer Bismarck, released in 1980, was the
		first historical computer wargame. Companies such as SSI, Avalon Hill, MicroProse, and Strategic Studies Group
		released many strategy titles throughout the 1980s. Reach for the Stars from 1983 was one of the first 4X
		strategy games, which expanded upon the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and
		conquest. That same year, Nobunaga's Ambition was a conquest-oriented grand strategy wargame with historical
		simulation elements. The Lords of Midnight combined elements of adventure, strategy and wargames, and won the
		Crash magazine award for Best Adventure game of 1984, as well as Best Strategy Game of the Year at the Golden
		Joystick Awards

		1989's Herzog Zwei is often considered the first real-time strategy game, although real-time strategy elements
		can be found in several earlier games, such as Dan Bunten's Cytron Masters and Don Daglow's Utopia in 1982; K≈çji
		Sumii's Bokosuka Wars in 1983; D. H. Lawson and John Gibson's Stonkers and Steven Faber's Epidemic! in 1983; and
		Evryware's The Ancient Art of War in 1984.

		The genre was popularized by Dune II three years later in 1992. Brett Sperry, the creator of Dune II, coined the
		name "real-time strategy" to help market the new game genre he helped popularize. Real-time strategy games
		changed the strategy genre by emphasizing the importance of time management, with less time to plan. Real-time
		strategy games eventually began to outsell turn-based strategy games.

		Since its first title was released in 2000, the Total War series by the Creative Assembly has become the most
		successful series of strategy games of all time, with sales of copies of Empire: Total War numbering in the
		millions.
	</p>

	<h2>Relationship to Other Genre</h2>
	<p>
		Even though there are many action games that involve strategic thinking, they are seldom classified as strategy
		games. A strategy game is typically larger in scope, and their main emphasis is on the player's ability to
		outthink their opponent. Strategy games rarely involve a physical challenge, and tend to annoy strategically
		minded players when they do. Compared to other genres such as action or adventure games where one player takes
		on many enemies, strategy games usually involve some level of symmetry between sides. Each side generally has
		access to similar resources and actions, with the strengths and weaknesses of each side being generally
		balanced.
	</p>
	<p>
		Although strategy games involve strategic, tactical, and sometimes logistical challenges, they are distinct from
		puzzle games. A strategy game calls for planning around a conflict between players, whereas puzzle games call
		for planning in isolation. Strategy games are also distinct from construction and management simulations, which
		include economic challenges without any fighting. These games may incorporate some amount of conflict, but are
		different from strategy games because they do not emphasize the need for direct action upon an opponent.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Although strategy games are similar to role-playing video games in that the player must manage units with a
		variety of numeric attributes, RPGs tend to be about a smaller number of unique characters, while strategy games
		focus on larger numbers of fairly similar units.
