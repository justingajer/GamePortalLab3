        <h2>Age of Mythology</h2>
            <p>
                Age of Mythology transports players to a time when heroes did battle with mosnters of legend and the gods intervened in the affairs of mortal men. 
                Players wage war using human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performace with improvements, 
                and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or 
                reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures.
